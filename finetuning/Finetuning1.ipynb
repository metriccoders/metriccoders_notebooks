The Indian team, which had been involved in a match fixing scandal, defeated Kenya, Australia, and South Africa in consecutive matches to reach the Finals. India lost to New Zealand in the Finals.[114] Dravid scored 157 runs in 4 matches of the tournament, at an average of 52.33, including 2 fifties.[115] He also scored 85 runs in a match against Zimbabwe in the 2000–01 Coca-Cola Champions Trophy while opening the innings but was forced to miss the rest of the tournament because of an injury.[114]\\n', \"Having regained his form on the tour to the West Indies, where he scored a match-winning hundred in Sabina park, Jamaica, Dravid then toured England in what was billed as the series that would decide the World No. 1 ranking in tests. In the first test at Lord's, in reply to England's 474, Dravid scored an undefeated 103, his first hundred at the ground where he debuted in 1996. He received scant support from his teammates as India's team was bowled out for 286 and lost the test.[178] The second test at Trentbridge in Nottingham again saw Dravid in successful form. Sent out to open the batting in place of an injured Gautam Gambhir, he scored his second successive hundred. His score of 117 again did not secure the team's victory, as a collapse of 6 wickets for 21 runs in the first innings led to a defeat by 319 runs.[179] Dravid failed in both innings in the third test at Birmingham, as India lost by an innings and 242 runs, one of the heaviest defeats in their history.[180] However, during the fourth and final match at The Oval, he opened the batting in place of Gambhir, and scored an undefeated 146 out of India's total of 300, carrying his bat through the innings. Once again, though, his efforts were in vain as India lost the match in a 0–4 whitewash.[181] In total, he scored 461 runs in the four matches at an average of 76.83 with three hundreds. He accounted for over 26% of India's runs in the series and was named India's man of the series by English coach Andy Flower. Dravid's performance in the series was met with admiration.[182][183]\\n\", ' \"India triumph in Pakistan Cup clash\". BBC News. Archived from the original on 22 January 2017.
